## Overview

Core functions with identical implementations for [Terraform], [OpenTofu], [Terratest], and other software in the so-called _Terra/Fu_ ecosystem.

While some of these _can_ be implemented in HCL, some of them begin to push up against the limits of Terraform and the HCL2 configuration language. Exposing these functions as both a Go library as well as a Terraform/OpenTofu provider enables us to use the same functionality in both our Terraform/OpenTofu applies as well as while using a testing framework.

The goal of this provider is not to call any network APIs, but to provide pre-built functions in the form of _Data Sources_ or _Provider Functions_.

## Vote for features!

[View the list of issues](https://github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc), and give a thumbs-up to the ones you'd like to see. This is how we prioritize the work.

## Compatibility testing

* We have automated testing that runs on every commit and every pull request.
* We intend for the Go libraries to work with all non-EOL versions of Go (i.e., current, current-1).
* Built using the [Terraform Plugin Framework][TPF], which speaks [Terraform Protocol v6][tfproto6].

## Usage Examples

See the `docs/` directory for user-facing documentation.

## Documentation

### Registries

* [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/northwood-labs/corefunc/latest/docs)
* [search.opentofu.org](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/northwood-labs/corefunc/latest)
* [library.tf](https://library.tf/providers/northwood-labs/corefunc/latest)

### Go Package

If you are using this as a Go library, see the documentation at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/corefunc).

## More Information

After the provider is installed, you can run `terraform-provider-corefunc` on the CLI.

* Install with either `terraform init` or `make build`.
* The Go binary path (discovered by running `./find-go-bin.sh`) is on your `$PATH`.

This will display the following text:

```bash
terraform-provider-corefunc
```

```plain
This binary is a plugin. These are not meant to be executed directly.
Please execute the program that consumes these plugins, which will
load any plugins automatically
```

However, by passing the `--help` flag, you can see the other options available, including a description of the software.

```bash
terraform-provider-corefunc --help
```

## Extras

We've also bundled some CLI commands that you might find as useful as we have.

### JSON → TOML

```bash
terraform-provider-corefunc json2toml file.json > file.toml
```

### TOML → JSON

```bash
terraform-provider-corefunc toml2json file.toml > file.json
```

## Ensuring quality

Northwood Labs takes testing seriously, and quality is a high priority for us. This software undergoes the following types of testing before every release.

### On every commit

* Unit testing of the Go library to ensure that the code behaves (and doesn't behave) as expected.
* Unit testing of the Go library’s documentation examples to ensure that the examples actually work.
* [Mutation testing](https://github.com/gtramontina/ooze) of the Go library to ensure that our tests are good at testing the code (as opposed to chasing code coverage).
* Acceptance testing of the provider (through both Terraform and OpenTofu) which uses [table-driven testing](https://go.dev/wiki/TableDrivenTests) to ensure that the inputs and expected outputs are correct.
* [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io) tests the provider using the same tools as one might use to test their own Terraform/OpenTofu modules.
* A _very_ strict set of linting rules using [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run).

### On every release

* [Fuzzing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/fuzz) of the Go library which throws garbage at the code to ensure edge-cases don't slip through.
* We use the [Bash Automated Testing System](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io) together with [tfschema](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfschema) to ensure that nothing weird or unexpected occurs with the [Terraform Plugin Protocol](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/terraform-plugin-protocol) v6 between releases.

### On a regular cadence

Supply-chain testing and validation. Some of these are on every commit, while a couple run before every release.
