## Example Usage

The `corefunc_toml_to_json` implementation converts between TOML and JSON, but not native types. In order to interchange with native Terraform/OpenTofu types, you will also need to leverage the built-in `jsonencode()` and `jsondecode()` functions.

~> Maps (like TOML, YAML, and JSON documents) do not maintain order by default. As such, there is no guarantee of order when converting between types.
