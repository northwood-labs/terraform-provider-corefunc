# {{ .RenderedProviderName }} Provider

-> We intend to support both Terraform as well as OpenTF with this provider.

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

## Setting-up the provider

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

## Updating your Terraform lockfile

Running `terraform init` will download the provider and update the [_Dependency Lock File_](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock) (`.terraform.lock.hcl`) for your _current_ OS and CPU architecture. If you have a team with multiple operating systems or multiple CPU architectures, the _Dependency Lock File_ will be incomplete, and other members on the team won't be able to use it.

In order to resolve this, you can use the `terraform providers lock` command to generate a _Dependency Lock File_ that is compatible with all relevant operating systems and CPU architectures.
