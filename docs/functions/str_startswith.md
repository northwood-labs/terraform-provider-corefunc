# str_startswith (function)

Takes a string to check and a prefix string, and returns true if the
string begins with that exact prefix.

-> This is identical to the built-in `startswith` function
which was added in Terraform 1.3. This provides a 1:1 implementation
that can be used with Terratest or other Go code, as well as with
OpenTofu and Terraform going all the way back to v1.0.

Maps to the [`corefunc.StrStartswith()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#StrStartswith) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).
