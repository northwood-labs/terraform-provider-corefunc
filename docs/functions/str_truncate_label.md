# str_truncate_label (function)

Supports prepending a prefix to a label, while truncating them
to meet the maximum length constraints. Useful when grouping labels with a
kind of prefix. Both the prefix and the label will be truncated if necessary.

Uses a “balancing” algorithm between the prefix and the label, so that each
section is truncated as a factor of how much space it takes up in the merged
string.

**DEPRECATED:** This function is deprecated and will be removed in the 2.0.0
release. It's a bit too specialized to be useful in a general-purpose library.

-> The motivation for this is in working with monitoring systems such
as New Relic and Datadog where there are hundreds of applications in a
monitoring “prod” account, and also hundreds of applications in a monitoring
“nonprod” account. This allows us to group lists of monitors together using a
shared prefix, but also truncate them appropriately to fit length
constraints for names.

Maps to the [`corefunc.TruncateLabel()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/corefunc#TruncateLabel) Go method, which can be used in
[Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

    "K8S Pods Not Running Deployment Check",
  )
}

#=> NW-ZZZ-CLOUD-TEST-APP-CLOUD-PR…: K8S Pods Not Running Deploymen…
```

## Arguments
