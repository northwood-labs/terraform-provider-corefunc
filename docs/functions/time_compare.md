# time_compare (function)

Compares two timestamps and returns a number which represents the
ordering of those timestamps.

When comparing timestamps, it takes into account the UTC offsets. For
example, `06:00:00+0200` and `04:00:00Z` are
the same moment after taking into account the `+0200`
offset on the first timestamp.

-> This is backwards compatible with the built-in `timecmp`
function which was added in Terraform 1.3. While Terraform and OpenTofu
both support the RFC3339 format for timestamps, this function supports a
wider range of timestamp formats for compatibility with various systems.

Maps to the [`corefunc.TimeCompare()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#TimeCompare) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Signature

<!-- signature generated by tfplugindocs -->
```text
time_compare(timestamp_a string, timestamp_b string) number
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
lifecycle {
  postcondition {
    condition = provider::corefunc::time_compare(
      timestamp(),
      timeadd(self.expiration_timestamp, "-720h")
    ) < 0

    error_message = "Certificate will expire in less than 30 days."
  }
}

output "timecmp1" {
  value = provider::corefunc::time_compare("2006-01-02T15:04:05Z", "2007-01-02T15:04:05Z")
}
```

## Arguments

1. `timestamp_a` (String) The first timestamp value to compare.
1. `timestamp_b` (String) The second timestamp value to compare.
