# str_base64_gunzip (function)

Base64Gunzip is a function that decodes a Base64-encoded string, then
decompresses the result with gzip. Supports both padded and non-padded Base64
strings.

Uses the "standard" Base64 alphabet as defined in
[RFC 4648 ยง4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4).

~> There is a data limit of 10 MiB (10485760 bytes) for the decompressed data. This
is to avoid "decompression bomb" vulnerabilities.

-> This functionality is built into OpenTofu 1.8, but is missing in Terraform 1.9.
This also provides a 1:1 implementation that can be used with Terratest or other
Go code.

Maps to the [`corefunc.Base64Gunzip()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#Base64Gunzip) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).
