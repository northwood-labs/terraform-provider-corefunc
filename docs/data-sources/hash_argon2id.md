# corefunc_hash_argon2id (Data Source)

Generates the Argon2id hash of a string with its associated salt value.

For the algorithm’s configuration, we’ve chosen parameters that balance security and performance.

```text
Time    = 1
Memory  = 64 MB
Threads = All
Key Length = 32 bytes
```

Maps to the [`corefunc.HashArgon2id()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#HashArgon2id) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_hash_argon2id" "hash_argon2id" {
  input = "hello world"
  salt  = "somesaltvalue"
}
