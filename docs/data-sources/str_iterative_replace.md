# corefunc_str_iterative_replace (Data Source)

Performs a series of replacements against a string. Allows a Terraform
module to accept a set of replacements from a user.

Maps to the [`corefunc.StrIterativeReplace()`](URL)
Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_str_iterative_replace" "replacements" {
  string = "This is a string for testing replacements. New Relic. Set-up."
  replacements = [
    {
      old = "."
      new = ""
    },
    {
      old = " "
      new = "_"
    },
    {
      old = "-"
      new = "_"
    },
    {
      old = "New Relic"
      new = "datadog"
    },
    {
      old = "This"
      new = "this"
    },
    {
      old = "Set-up"
      new = "setup"
    },
  ]
}
