# corefunc_url_parse (Data Source)

URLParse is a [WHATWG spec-compliant](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing) URL parser returns a struct
representing a parsed absolute URL.

Will not resolve relative URLs. The parser is up to date as of
[2023-05-24](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/eee49fdf4f99d59f717cbeb0bce29fda930196d4/)
and passes all relevant tests from
[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/url). Its API is similar to Chapter 6
in [WHATWG URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api).

Maps to the [`corefunc.URLParse()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#URLParse) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

### Simple

```terraform
data "corefunc_url_parse" "simple" {
  url = "https://example.com"
}

#=> .normalized        = "https://example.com/"
#=> .normalized_nofrag = "https://example.com/"
#=> .protocol          = "https:"
#=> .scheme            = "https"
#=> .host              = "example.com"
#=> .path              = "/"
#=> .decoded_port      = 443
```

### Complex

```terraform
data "corefunc_url_parse" "complex" {
  url = "HTTP://u:p@example.com:80/foo?q=1#bar"
}

#=> .normalized        = "http://u:p@example.com/foo?q=1#bar"
#=> .normalized_nofrag = "http://u:p@example.com/foo?q=1"
#=> .protocol          = "http:"
#=> .scheme            = "http"
#=> .username          = "u"
#=> .password          = "p"
#=> .host              = "example.com"
#=> .port              = ""
#=> .path              = "/foo"
#=> .search            = "?q=1"
#=> .query             = "q=1"
#=> .hash              = "#bar"
#=> .fragment          = "bar"
#=> .decoded_port      = 80
```

### Complex (with Google Safe Browsing canonicalizer)

[Google Safe Browsing](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/urls-hashing#canonicalization)
is a URL canonicalizer with a different set of rules from standard WHATWG URLs.

```terraform
data "corefunc_url_parse" "gsb" {
  url           = "HTTP://u:p@example.com:80/foo?q=1#bar"
  canonicalizer = "google_safe_browsing"
}

#=> .normalized        = "http://u:p@example.com/foo?q=1"
#=> .normalized_nofrag = "http://u:p@example.com/foo?q=1"
#=> .protocol          = "http:"
#=> .scheme            = "http"
#=> .username          = "u"
#=> .password          = "p"
#=> .host              = "example.com"
#=> .port              = ""
#=> .path              = "/foo"
#=> .search            = "?q=1"
#=> .query             = "q=1"
#=> .hash              = ""
#=> .fragment          = ""
#=> .decoded_port      = 80
```

* `hostname` (String) The hostname of the URL.
* `normalized` (String) The normalized form of the URL.
* `normalized_nofrag` (String) The normalized form of the URL, without the fragment.
* `password` (String) The password that was passed to the URL as basic authentication.
* `path` (String) The path of the URL.
* `port` (String) The port of the URL. May be blank if web browsers typically hide the port in the URL bar.
