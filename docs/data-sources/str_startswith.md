# corefunc_str_startswith (Data Source)

Takes a string to check and a prefix string, and returns true if the
string begins with that exact prefix.

-> This is identical to the built-in `startswith` function
which was added in Terraform 1.3. This provides a 1:1 implementation
that can be used with Terratest or other Go code, as well as with
OpenTofu and Terraform going all the way back to v1.0.

Maps to the [`corefunc.StrStartsWith()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#StrStartsWith) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_str_startswith" "str_startswith" {
  input  = "hello world"
  prefix = "hello"
}

#=> true
```
