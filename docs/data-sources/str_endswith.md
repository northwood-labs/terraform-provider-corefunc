# corefunc_str_endswith (Data Source)

Takes a string to check and a suffix string, and returns true if the
string ends with that exact suffix.

-> This is identical to the built-in `endswith` function
which was added in Terraform 1.3. This provides a 1:1 implementation
that can be used with Terratest or other Go code, as well as with
OpenTofu and Terraform going all the way back to v1.0.

Maps to the [`corefunc.StrEndsWith()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#StrEndsWith) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_str_endswith" "str_endswith" {
  input  = "hello world"
  suffix = "world"
}

#=> true
```
