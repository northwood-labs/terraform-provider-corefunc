# corefunc_env_ensure (Data Source)

Ensures that a given environment variable is set to a non-empty value.
If the environment variable is unset or if it is set to an empty string,
it will trigger a Terraform-level error.

Not every Terraform provider checks to ensure that the environment variables it
requires are properly set before performing work, leading to late-stage errors.
This will force an error to occur early in the execution if the environment
variable is not set, or if its value doesn't match the expected patttern.

Maps to the [`corefunc.EnvEnsure()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/corefunc#EnvEnsure) Go method, which can be used in
[Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

data "corefunc_env_ensure" "aws_default_region" {
  name = "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"
}

# `aws_default_region_value` is the read-only attribute containing the
# value of the environment variable
output "aws_default_region_value" {
  value = data.corefunc_env_ensure.aws_default_region.value
}

#=> us-east-1

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AWS_PAGER=""

data "corefunc_env_ensure" "aws_pager" {
  name = "AWS_PAGER"
}

#=> [Error] Problem with Environment Variable: environment variable
#=>         AWS_PAGER is not defined

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AWS_VAULT="dev"

data "corefunc_env_ensure" "aws_vault" {
  name    = "AWS_VAULT"
  pattern = "(non)?prod$" # Must end with "prod" or "nonprod".
}

#=> [Error] Problem with Environment Variable: environment variable
#=>         AWS_VAULT does not match pattern (non)?prod$
```
