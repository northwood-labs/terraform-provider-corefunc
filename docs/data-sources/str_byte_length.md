# corefunc_str_byte_length (Data Source)

Counts the number of bytes in a string.

This is different from the length of a string in characters, as some
characters may be represented by multiple bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

Maps to the [`corefunc.StrByteLength()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#StrByteLength) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_str_byte_length" "bytes1" {
  string = "abcde"
}

#=> 5

data "corefunc_str_byte_length" "bytes2" {
  string = "♫"
}

#=> 1

data "corefunc_str_byte_length" "bytes3" {
  string = "界"
}

#=> 2

data "corefunc_str_byte_length" "bytes4" {
  string = "スター☆"
}

#=> 7
```
