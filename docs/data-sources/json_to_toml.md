# corefunc_json_to_toml (Data Source)

Converts a JSON string into an equivalent TOML string.

Maps to the [`corefunc.JSONtoTOML()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#JSONtoTOML) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

The `corefunc_json_to_toml` implementation converts between JSON and TOML, but not native types. In order to interchange with native Terraform/OpenTofu types, you will also need to leverage the built-in `jsonencode()` and `jsondecode()` functions.

~> Maps (like TOML, YAML, and JSON documents) do not maintain order by default. As such, there is no guarantee of order when converting between types.

```terraform
# Read a JSON file…
data "corefunc_json_to_toml" "json_to_toml" {
  json = file("${path.module}/hello.json")
}

# …and write a TOML file.
resource "local_file" "toml_file" {
  content  = data.corefunc_json_to_toml.json_to_toml.toml
  filename = "${path.module}/hello.toml"
}
```
