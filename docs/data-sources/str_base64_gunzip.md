# corefunc_str_base64_gunzip (Data Source)

Base64Gunzip is a function that decodes a Base64-encoded string, then
decompresses the result with gzip. Supports both padded and non-padded Base64
strings.

-> This functionality is built into OpenTofu 1.8, but is missing in Terraform 1.9.
This also provides a 1:1 implementation that can be used with Terratest or other
Go code.

Maps to the [`corefunc.Base64Gunzip()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/corefunc#Base64Gunzip) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_str_base64_gunzip" "str" {
  gzipped_base64 = "H4sIAAAAAAAA/8pIrVTISK3UUShPVS9KVSjJSFXIzc/LTk0tBgQAAP//qz+dmhoAAAA"
}

#=> hey hey, we're the monkees
