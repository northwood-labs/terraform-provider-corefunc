# corefunc_hash_argon2id_base64 (Data Source)

Generates the Argon2id hash of a string with its associated salt value. Returns a Base64
value instead of a hexadecimal string.

For the algorithm’s configuration, we’ve chosen parameters that balance security and performance.

```text
Time    = 1

```

Maps to the [`corefunc.Base64HashArgon2id()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#Base64HashArgon2id) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_hash_argon2id_base64" "hash_argon2id_base64" {
  input = "hello world"
  salt  = "somesaltvalue"
}

* `input` (String) The string to generate the Argon2id hash for.
* `salt` (String) A random value to provide additional entropy in the calculation.

### Read-Only

* `value` (String) The result of the hashing function.
