# corefunc_url_decode (Data Source)

URLDecode decodes a URL-encoded string.

It can decode a wide range of characters, including those beyond the ASCII set.
Non-ASCII characters are first interpreted as UTF-8 bytes, then percent-decoded
byte-by-byte, ensuring correct decoding of multibyte characters.

-> This functionality is built into OpenTofu 1.8, but is missing in Terraform 1.9.
This also provides a 1:1 implementation that can be used with Terratest or other
Go code.

Maps to the [`corefunc.URLDecode()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#URLDecode) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_url_decode" "url" {
  encoded_url = "mailto%3Aemail%3Fsubject%3Dthis%2Bis%2Bmy%2Bsubject"
}

#=> mailto:email?subject=this+is+my+subject
```
