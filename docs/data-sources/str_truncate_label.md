# corefunc_str_truncate_label (Data Source)

Supports prepending a prefix to a label, while truncating them
to meet the maximum length constraints. Useful when grouping labels with a
kind of prefix. Both the prefix and the label will be truncated if necessary.

Uses a “balancing” algorithm between the prefix and the label, so that each
section is truncated as a factor of how much space it takes up in the merged
string.

-> The motivation for this is in working with monitoring systems such
as New Relic and Datadog where there are hundreds of applications in a
monitoring “prod” account, and also hundreds of applications in a monitoring
“nonprod” account. This allows us to group lists of monitors together using a
shared prefix, but also truncate them appropriately to fit length
constraints for names.

Maps to the [`corefunc.TruncateLabel()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/corefunc#TruncateLabel) Go method, which can be used in
[Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Pass the prefix and the label, then limit to 64 characters

data "corefunc_str_truncate_label" "label" {
  prefix     = "NW-ZZZ-CLOUD-TEST-APP-CLOUD-PROD-CRIT"
  label      = "K8S Pods Not Running Deployment Check"
  max_length = 64
}

# `value` is the read-only attribute containing the truncated label

output "value" {
  value = data.corefunc_str_truncate_label.label.value
}

# => NW-ZZZ-CLOUD-TEST-APP-CLOUD-PR…: K8S Pods Not Running Deploymen…
```
