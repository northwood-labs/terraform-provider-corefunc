# corefunc_net_cidr_contains (Data Source)

CIDRContains determines whether or not a given IP address, or an address prefix
given in CIDR notation, is within a given IP network address prefix.

Both arguments must belong to the same address family, either IPv4 or IPv6. A
family mismatch will result in an error.

~> This functionality is built into OpenTofu 1.8, but has not been implemented
in Terraform (as of version 1.15).

-> This port from OpenTofu provides a 1:1 implementation that can be used with
Terratest or other Go code, as well as with OpenTofu and Terraform going all
the way back to v1.0.

Maps to the [`corefunc.CIDRContains()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#CIDRContains) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_net_cidr_contains" "cidr" {
  containing_cidr      = "192.168.2.0/20"
  contained_ip_or_cidr = "192.168.2.1"
}

#=> true
```
