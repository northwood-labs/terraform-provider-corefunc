# corefunc_time_compare (Data Source)

Compares two timestamps and returns a number which represents the
ordering of those timestamps.

When comparing timestamps, it takes into account the UTC offsets. For
example, `06:00:00+0200` and `04:00:00Z` are
the same moment after taking into account the `+0200`
offset on the first timestamp.

-> This is backwards compatible with the built-in `timecmp`
function which was added in Terraform 1.3. While Terraform and OpenTofu
both support the RFC3339 format for timestamps, this function supports a
wider range of timestamp formats for compatibility with various systems.

Maps to the [`corefunc.TimeCompare()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/northwood-labs/terraform-provider-corefunc/v2/corefunc#TimeCompare) Go method, which can be used in [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "corefunc_time_compare" "timecmp1" {
  timestamp_a = timestamp()
  timestamp_b = timeadd(self.expiration_timestamp, "-720h")
}

lifecycle {
  postcondition {
    condition     = data.corefunc_time_compare.timecmp1.value < 0
    error_message = "Certificate will expire in less than 30 days."
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

* `timestamp_a` (String) The first timestamp value to compare.
* `timestamp_b` (String) The second timestamp value to compare.

### Read-Only

* `value` (Number) An integer indicating the comparison result. A value of `-1` indicates that `timestamp_a` is less than `timestamp_b`, `0` indicates that they are equal, and `1` indicates that `timestamp_a` is greater than `timestamp_b`.
