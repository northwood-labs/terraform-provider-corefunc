## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a legitimate security vulnerability, please report it to <ryan@ryanparman.com>.

There is no bounty program, and there are no payments for discovering/reporting security vulnerabilities, but we **all** benefit from software that is more secure. Happy to provide public thanks once the issue has been resolved.

What I need is:

* An explanation of the bug.
* A minimum viable reproduction case which triggers the issue.
* What you expected to happen.
* What actually happened.
* [OPTIONAL] A suggested patch attached as a .diff file, if you have one.

I don't check my email every day, and I get LOTS of email. It may take me up to a week to discover your message. I will respond as soon as I see your message and confirm that I can reproduce the issue.

Thank you for participating in the _responsible disclosure_ of security vulnerabilities.
