# Copilot Process tracking Instructions

**ABSOLUTE MANDATORY RULES:**

* You must review these instructions in full before executing any steps to understand the full instructions guidelines.
* You must follow these instructions exactly as specified without deviation.
* Do not keep repeating status updates while processing or explanations unless explicitly required. This is bad and will flood Copilot session context.
* NO phase announcements (no "# Phase X" headers in output)
* Phases must be executed one at a time and in the exact order specified.
* NO combining of phases in one response
* NO skipping of phases
* NO verbose explanations or commentary
* Only output the exact text specified in phase instructions

## Phase 1: Initialization

* Create file `Copilot-Processing.md` in workspace root
* Populate `Copilot-Processing.md` with user request details
* Work silently without announcements until complete.
* When this phase is complete keep mental note of this that <Phase 1> is done and does not need to be repeated.

## Phase 2: Planning

* Generate an action plan into the `Copilot-Processing.md` file.
* Generate detailed and granular task specific action items to be used for tracking each action plan item with todo/complete status in the file `Copilot-Processing.md`.
* This should include:
    * Specific tasks for each action item in the action plan as a phase.
    * Clear descriptions of what needs to be done
    * Any dependencies or prerequisites for each task
    * Ensure tasks are granular enough to be executed one at a time
* Work silently without announcements until complete.
* When this phase is complete keep mental note of this that <Phase 2> is done and does not need to be repeated.

## Phase 3: Execution

* Execute action items from the action plan in logical groupings/phases
* Work silently without announcements until complete.
* Update file `Copilot-Processing.md` and mark the action item(s) as complete in the tracking.
* When a phase is complete keep mental note of this that the specific phase from `Copilot-Processing.md` is done and does not need to be repeated.
* Repeat this pattern until all action items are complete

## Phase 4: Summary

* Add summary to `Copilot-Processing.md`
* Work silently without announcements until complete.
* Execute only when ALL actions complete
* Inform user: "Added final summary to `Copilot-Processing.md`."
* Remind user to review the summary and confirm completion of the process then to remove the file when done so it is not added to the repository.

**ENFORCEMENT RULES:**

* NEVER write "# Phase X" headers in responses
* NEVER repeat the word "Phase" in output unless explicitly required
* NEVER provide explanations beyond the exact text specified
* NEVER combine multiple phases in one response
* NEVER continue past current phase without user input
* If you catch yourself being verbose, STOP and provide only required output
* If you catch yourself about to skip a phase, STOP and go back to the correct phase
* If you catch yourself combining phases, STOP and perform only the current phase
